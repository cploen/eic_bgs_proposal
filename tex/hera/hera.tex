To establish the validity of future simulations using current software tools, GEMC, Geant4, and the JLEIC initial distribution generator were benchmarked against background rates measured at HERA following the luminosity upgrade.  By replicating HERA conditions, simulations produced background rates that were comparable to those recorded in HERA's C5 detector.  Successfully reproducing these rates validates several software tools for background studies and underscores both the need and readiness to conduct JLEIC background studies at this time.

\subsection{HERA Issues and Lessons}

Following the HERA-II upgrade in 2000 and 2001, high levels of beam-induced background were observed and identified: synchrotron radiation, proton gas scattering, lepton gas scattering, and proton beam halo losses.   In fact, 95\% of background observed following the upgrade came from proton beam-gas interactions where vacuum conditions had deteriorated due to synchrotron radiation.  The background impacted the detectors and necessitated a several month shutdown to perform simulations and remediate the problem.

High levels of synchrotron radiation had been expected after the HERA upgrade, since the luminosity increase was achieved by stronger beam focusing (lower $\beta^*$) and required upgraded focusing magnets, changes to the machine lattice, and a redesigned IR. Unique vacuum chamber geometry, collimators, and masks were installed to handle the expected increase in background.  However, adequately detailed background studies were not conducted ahead of time, and these changes generated significantly more machine-induced background than anticipated.  A several month shutdown was necessary to perform additional simulations and develop mitigation strategies.  Until 2004, HERA-II operations were current-limited due to background.

During the shutdown, the HERA team performed detailed simulations of the dynamic pressure profile and residual beam gas analysis to determine the best mitigation strategies.  Results indicated that vacuum pressure, dominated by hydrogen gas, spiked to $10^{-8}$ mbar in the region spanning $\pm$ 5 m around the IP.   This  was 100 times higher than the nominal pressure of $10^{-10}$ mbar achieved at the location of the vacuum pumps.  Beam particles interacted with the hydrogen gas, producing halo particles which constituted a large portion of the background events reaching the ZEUS detector.  The C5 counter was placed very close to the beam pipe to measure the rate and arrival times of these halo particles.

\subsection{Detector Geometry}

The C5 detector was a silicon tungsten sandwich counter comprised of eight scintillator tiles mounted in pairs above and below the beampipe, orthogonal to the z axis.  The arrangement of the 3 mm thick tiles created an octagon with an outer profile of 20 cm by 20 cm, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hera5}.  The detector was positioned 1240 mm upstream from the IP around the cylindrical aluminum beampipe of radius 19 mm.

\subsection{Detector Rates}
The primary uses of the C5 detector were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item to detect the presence of halo particles in order to reduce background event rates in ZEUS.
	\item to provide rate and arrival time measurements for monitoring and controlling HERA beam conditions.
	\item to calculate the $Z$ vertex position.
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig:hera3} shows the C5 rates as a function of HERA electron beam current for several proton beam currents.  Although the rates in the C5 varied as a function of current, they provide a range by which to base the benchmarking study.  Figure \ref{fig:hera3} indicates that the rate in the C5 detector was approximately 10 kHz for I$_{p}$ = 40 mA, for I$_{e+}$ between 2 mA and 7 mA.

\subsection{Approach}

In order to benchmark simulation tools against the observed background rates, a virtual detector was modeled after the C5 detector and positioned at the same location relative to the IP.  A beam pipe with the same specifications as the original was filled with a hydrogen target of density proportional to the vacuum quality of the corresponding region at HERA.  

Key parameters were either matched to the HERA case, scaled, or shown to exert little influence over the event rate.  These are summarized below:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ l l l }[!hbt]
		& HERA & Simulated \\ 
		\hline \hline
		Gate Time & 96 ns & 100 ns \\ 
		$p$ bunch length & 100 mm & n/a \\ 
		$I_p$ & 100 mA & 100 mA\\
		$E_p$ (GeV)& 920 & 900 $\pm$ 1 \\
		$N$/bunch & $10^{11}$ & $10^{11}$\\
		$N$ Events & n/a & $\approx 10^6$\\
		vacuum near IP& $10^{-8}$ mbar  & 1 g/cm$^3$ H \\
		Vacuum else& $10^{-10}$ mbar & 0.01 g/cm$^3$ H\\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}


To replicate the C5 detector, a two-disc scintillator detector was built in GEMC and placed 1240 mm upstream from the IP.  Like the actual C5 detector, the virtual detector was comprised of discs 3 mm thick, separated by 20 mm.  The inner and outer radii also matched the original: $R_{in} = 3.801/2$ cm and $R_{out} = 20.0/2$ cm.  The detector was assigned "flux" sensitivity, so that different tracks record different hits independent of the time window.

HERA's beampipe from 2002 was replicated by modeling a simple cylindrical beam pipe out of 0.5mm thick aluminum with inner radius 19mm.  It was filled with hydrogen gas of density proportional to  $10^{-8}$ mbar $\pm$5 m around IP and $10^{-10}$ mbar everywhere else.

GEMC's native beam distribution generator was initialized directly before the higher pressure region and fired approximately $10^6$ protons toward the IP.  Both 100 and 900 GeV particles were simulated, with a momentum spread of $\pm$ 1 GeV, 0.2 mrad spread in $\phi$ and $2\pi$ rad spread in $\theta$.  All particles hitting the detector, both charged and neutral, were recorded and their information stored in an EVIO file.  Data was analyzed in ROOT after file conversion and making a cut along the $z$ axis in the location of the detector.  The number of neutral particles recorded in the detector was then subtracted from the total, and counts were normalized to exactly $10^6$ events.  This number, along with previously stated assumptions and scale factors, was used to calculate the rate of particles seen in the virtual C5 and compared to HERA-II data.

The basic HERA configuration was simulated: i.e., a 900 GeV proton beam was fired from the center of the beam pipe in front of the higher density gas region and the detector hits were recorded.  Two Geant4 physics models were compared and the results are noted below.  Additionally, simulations were performed to compare the results of lower beam energy, external beam distribution generator with JLEIC parameters, varying degraded vacuum region length, varying degraded vacuum region density, and varying beam pipe composition.

\subsection{Analysis and Results}
The rate of particles in the virtual C5 detector was calculated by $I = qE\cdot N/t$.  With HERA parameters, the virtual C5 detector measured approximately 33kHz for charged particle events, which compares favorably to HERA data.  

Additional simulations verified the relationship between vacuum density and length of degraded vacuum region.  Increasing the density of the hydrogen gas produced higher event rates, as expected.  Similarly, increasing the length of the degraded vacuum region produced higher event rates than the baseline HERA configuration.  The results of these comparisons are reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:hera5} and \ref{fig:hera6}, with the HERA configuration highlighted.

\end{figure}



Simulations  performed to compare beam energy at 100 GeV and 900 GeV did not produce noteworthy differences in background rates.  Additional studies comparing the GEANT4 physics models found event rates to be approximately 25\% higher using the FRITIOF precompound model (FTFP) versus the Quark-Gluon String Precompound model (QGSP).  Beam pipe composition was also compared, and aluminum beam pipes were found to produce 25\% more background than a beryllium/aluminum mix.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The benchmarking study has confirmed that using HERA parameters, the GEMC software produces data in agreement with the experimental results from HERA.  Additionally, the initial distribution generator, which accurately models JLEIC beam parameters, indicates similarly high levels of proton beam-gas background for HERA vacuum conditions.  This validates future results produced with these tools and reinforces both the need and readiness to undertake further studies of the beam gas interactions generated in the EIC.  

To build upon these studies, it is necessary to implement the IR beam pipe design in GEMC and CAD in order to 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Determine the influence of EIC IR geometry on proton beam-gas background using EIC initial  bunch distributions.
	\item Validate the assertion that $10^{-9}$ mbar vacuum pressure provides tolerable vacuum conditions and begin to develop possible pumping schemes.
	\item Validate the synchrotron radiation event generator in GEANT4/GEMC.
	\item Determine figure-of-merit for synchrotron radiation due to electron beam-gas interactions.
	\item Evaluate the effectiveness of a small chicane along the upstream electron beamline for minimizing the beamline synchrotron radiation contribution.
\end{itemize}

Such measures are within the scope of this proposal.
