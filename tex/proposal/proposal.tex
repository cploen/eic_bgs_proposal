\subsection{what this proposal aims to achieve, its focus and why}
- finalization of HERA benchmarking results

- beam pipe modeling in GEMC

- benchmarking of Mike Sullivan's SR code with SR in Geant4/GEMC

- initially naive calculations of vacuum pressure distribution based on geometry, iterated over Mike Sullivan's SR estimations and any variations of beam pipe design, to establish range of expected vacuum levels and vacuum pump schemes based on current IR placement.
