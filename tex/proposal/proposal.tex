\subsection{what this proposal aims to achieve, its focus and why}
- finalization of HERA benchmarking results (maybe mention in HERA section but not list as first thing we do since finishing stuff isn't very compelling)

- beam pipe modeling in GEMC

- balloon of beam pipe interior in both GEMC and CAD (necessary for simulations and Molflow calculations)

- benchmarking of Mike Sullivan's SR code with SR in Geant4/GEMC

- initially naive calculations of vacuum pressure distribution based on geometry, iterated over Mike Sullivan's SR estimations and any variations of beam pipe design, to establish range of expected vacuum levels and vacuum pump schemes based on current IR placement.
