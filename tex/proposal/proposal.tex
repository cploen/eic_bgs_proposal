We define that background is the event in which experiments are affected by unwanted particles entering from the machine.
Such background can interfer the machine regular operation and even worsly have a potential damage that ends up machine
failure, including Crab cavity failure and asynchronous beam dump.


In general, machine background should be well understood not only in advance of the machine operation but also optimal
design of detectors as well as shielding. The lesson from the HERA II commissioning after the upgrade, very severe
backgrounds were observed, and the machine had to be shut down for several months. While studies of the backgrounds
were performed and solutions to mitigate the backgrounds were installed. Their major source of background comes from
large proton beam-gas interactions and increased synchrotron radiation. Since a proposed Electron-Ion-Collider(EIC)
is similar machine as HERA (electron-proton-collider) although there are many different features, their major background
sources could be same issue.


Recently, LHC had dedicated tests during 2015-2016 to understand machine-induced background through studying in terms of
a loss map for beam-halo, pressure bump for local beam-gas interaction. In particular, it turned out that beam-gas interaction
is the most dominant background by high limunosity experiment analysis results \cite{Bruce:2016}.


The proposed study will focus on estimating machine-induced backgrounds to the detectors, giving crucial information
to all groups designing detector systems on the radiation environment in which the devices will operate. The study
will additionally be applicable for two EIC designs.



In reality, there are crucial questions related to machine-induced background that should be addressed:
\begin{itemize}
\item{1} Can we understand better at what level background become problematic ?
\item{2} What can we demonstrate such background ? How we can evaluate these ?
\item{3} Waht can be done to improve safty for operation ?
\end{itemize}



In simplification, the goals of this proposal is following:
\begin{itemize}
\item{1} Identify the background sources for given baseline design parameters
\item{2} Quantify the background level
\item{3} Suggest or provide possible solution or modification
\end{itemize}

Firt of all, it is very important to identify what is the background source that causes severe problem during beam operation
or detection capability. For example, synchrotron radiation is very critical source for tracking detector near the interaction
point. Hence shielding or controlling this radiation is key to improve the tracking efficiency. Secondly, once we know source
of background, we should evaluate how much background level will be expected for given operational parameters. By doing this
study, it will immediately provide an idea or solution how we can improve or optimize the run configuration or detector design
or shielding.


$\cdot$ Emphasize aspects of common interest bewteen eRHIC and JLEIC. \\


In this proposal, we would like to study various source of machine-induced backgrounds, such as Synchrotron radiation,
 Beam-gas interactions, Beam halo, Beam losses, Neutron flux and Radiation from elastic scattering. Such backgrounds
 are major and common concerns independent of machine. However, they are not always clearly indentified as separated
 effects.  We hence propose a study for any correlation among these sources with respect to accelerator machine and
 detector design through sophisticated Monte Calro simulation based on GEANT4 with various event generators.
Therefore this will be a very important study for both eRHIC and JLEIC to understand and evaluate all these sources
with respect to design parameters and operational configurations.


Detailed simulation studies need to be performed for the relevant background sources.
A subset of sources of background we will study are itemized section.XXX.
Such simulation results will be directly input to improve experimental detector response.
